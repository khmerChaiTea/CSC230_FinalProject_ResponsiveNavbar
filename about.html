            Hello, my name is Prem Chhay, and I'm currently transitioning from a
            distinguished 20-year career in the U.S. Navy as a Culinary
            Specialist with an active Secret Clearance. My service allowed me to
            travel extensively, experiencing diverse cultures in countries such
            as Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Hong Kong, Dubai, Bahrain, and
            Italy. Fluent in both English and Khmer, I bring a global
            perspective to my work.<br /><br />
            Upon completing my military service, I enrolled in the Washington
            Vets to Tech program, focusing on Cloud Application Development.
            I've gained proficiency in Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            Now, I'm eager to pivot into a new career in Software Development,
            and I'm particularly interested in opportunities with your
            company.<br /><br />
            With a strong background in management, problem-solving, team
            collaboration, and customer service, I believe I can bring valuable
            skills and a fresh perspective to your team for the long term.
          </p>

          <h2>Education</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="main__img--container">
          <p>
            I graduated from San Gabriel High School in San Gabriel, California.
            I began my studies at the University of Riverside, majoring in
            Computer Engineering for a year. However, due to my family needing
            assistance, I paused my education and worked as a store clerk while
            attending Pasadena Community College in Pasadena, California. During
            this time, a Navy recruiter reached out to me with enticing offers
            such as citizenship and financial support for college.<br /><br />
            Seeking a stable career to support my living expenses, I joined the
            military. Throughout my military service, I managed to take college
            classes sporadically, although the demands of military service
            prevented me from completing a degree. Fortunately, I have been
            granted a second chance to pursue a career in the IT field, which
            has always been my aspiration.

            CSS, and JavaScript while attending the Washington Vets to Tech
            program (WaV2T).

            I am interested in an entry-level role as a Cloud Applications
            Developer, Software Engineer, or in customer support roles. I am
            dedicated to continuous learning and personal growth. I excel in
            collaborative environments where I can leverage my skills to
            contribute to organizational success.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am passionate about video games, the evolution of the internet,
            technological advancements, robotics, AI, and innovations that
            enhance daily life. Leveraging my proficiency in mathematics up to
            calculus, I aspire to make a positive impact through information
            technology and coding.
